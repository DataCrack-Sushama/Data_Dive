## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict Walmart's future sales based on historical data using time series forecasting techniques. We use both dynamic forecasting and visualization tools to provide clear insights into sales trends, allowing businesses to plan better and make data-driven decisions.

### Problem Statement
Walmart, like many retail businesses, experiences fluctuations in sales throughout the year. Accurate forecasting of sales can help optimize stock management, staffing, and other business operations. This project explores how time series forecasting can be used to predict future sales using historical data.

## Motivation
Retail businesses, especially large ones like Walmart, need to predict their sales as accurately as possible. Understanding future trends can be a game-changer in managing inventory, supply chains, and overall customer satisfaction. This project was developed to illustrate how historical sales data can be used to create actionable predictions for future sales.

## Key Insights
- **Trend Analysis**: Analysis of sales trends over multiple years to identify seasonal spikes and downward trends.
- **Dynamic Forecasting**: Future sales are dynamically forecasted, and the model adjusts to new incoming data.
- **Confidence Intervals**: The project incorporates confidence intervals to show the range within which future sales values are expected to fall.
- **Data Visualization**: Visual representations of the forecast help simplify the interpretation of complex time series data.

## Tech Stack
This project utilizes a range of Python tools and libraries:
- **Python 3.9**: Core programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To run the code and document results.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting and visualizing data.
- **Statsmodels**: For building the time series forecasting models.
- **NumPy**: To handle numerical computations.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the data for analysis, handling any missing values or inconsistencies.
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Uses `statsmodels` to create time series models, specifically ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models.
- **Dynamic Predictions**: Allows the model to adjust predictions as new data becomes available.
- **Visualization**: Clearly visualizes both the actual and predicted sales values, along with confidence intervals.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/walmart_sales_forecasting.git
cd walmart_sales_forecasting
Step 2: Install Dependencies
To install the required Python packages, use the requirements.txt file provided:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Run the Jupyter Notebook
Launch the Jupyter notebook to view the analysis and results:
jupyter notebook wallmart.ipynb
Step 4: Explore the Data
Once the notebook is open, you can step through each cell to:
•	Load and explore the dataset.
•	Build time series models.
•	Forecast future sales and visualize results.

Data Sources
The sales data used in this project was simulated to represent typical retail sales, but can easily be adapted for real-world Walmart sales data. If you have real data, you can replace the existing dataset with your own by following the data structure outlined in the notebook.

Usage
In the wallmart.ipynb notebook, you will find:
•	Data Loading: Loading the sales data into a pandas DataFrame.
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying patterns, seasonality, and anomalies in the sales data.
•	Forecasting Model: Creating an ARIMA model to predict future sales.
•	Dynamic Forecast: The model predicts sales dynamically, adjusting to new data as it arrives.
Results
This analysis provides:
•	Observed vs. Predicted Sales: A side-by-side comparison of actual sales versus forecasted sales.
•	Sales Forecast Graphs: Visualizations that clearly show the trend of future sales, with shaded regions indicating confidence intervals.
•	Actionable Insights: Insights into how future sales trends may look, which can inform decision-making for stock management and business operations.
Sample Visualization
You can expect to see visual outputs like this:
•	A plot of observed sales vs. dynamically forecasted sales.
•	Confidence intervals shaded to show the uncertainty of future predictions.
